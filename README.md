# Autoencoders_SOMs
* Implementation of five types of Autoencoders combined with Self-Organizing Maps. 

* Performance comparison of SOMs based on different AEs.

* Three different data sets are used for training.

* R codes can plot the Embedding Accuracy, Estimated Topographic Accuracy, and Convergence Accuracy of each model.
